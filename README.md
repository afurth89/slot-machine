##Desired Improvements
This application was built over a few days, so there is still much that I'd like to do to improve the project. Here are a number of things I'd like to improve on. This list is largely to keep track of my own thoughts, but if you have suggestions please let me know: [andrew.furth@gmail.com](mailto:andrew.furth@gmail.com)

1. Implementing Sass to abstract some of the CSS.
2. Use CSS3 transitions, transformations and keyframes to implement a "pulling lever" animation (Similar to [https://codepen.io/elalemanyo/pen/aGjql](https://codepen.io/elalemanyo/pen/aGjql))
3. Add sound on spin
